    <h3>Regex Wild Character</h3>

            Match Anything with Wildcard Period
            Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the 
            exact characters in your patterns. Thinking of all
             words that match, say, a misspelling would take a 
             long time. Luckily, you can save time using the 
             wildcard character: .
        </p>
        <p>
            The wildcard character . will match any one 
            character. The wildcard is also called dot and
             period. You can use the wildcard character just 
             like any other character in the regex. 
             For example, if you wanted to match hug, huh, hut,
              and hum, you can use the regex /hu./ to match all four words.

Match Letters of the Alphabet
You saw how you can use character sets to specify a group of characters to match, but that's a lot of typing when you need to match a large range of characters (for example, every letter in the alphabet). Fortunately, there is a built-in feature that makes this short and simple.

Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: -.

For example, to match lowercase letters a through e you would use [a-e].

let catStr = "cat"; <br>
let batStr = "bat"; <br>
let matStr = "mat"; <br>
let bgRegex = /[a-e]at/; <br>
catStr.match(bgRegex); <br>
batStr.match(bgRegex); <br>
matStr.match(bgRegex); <br>

In order, the three match calls would return the values ["cat"], ["bat"], and null.

Match all the letters in the string quoteSample.

Note: Be sure to match both uppercase and lowercase letters.
